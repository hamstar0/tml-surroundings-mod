v1
-	Create API
-	Disable when lighting mode is shit
-	Set fireflies to not occur during rain or event
-	Add firefly halos (Projectile_540, Glow_239, Sun)
-	Set mists to exist on their own layer
-	Set mists to use their own brightness checking
-	Set mists to need air space to exist
-	Lower tree layers (all biomes) top elevation and check for percent of solid tiles
-	Prioritize hallow/corr/crim over desert/ice
-	Prevent mist within solid or liquid blocks
-	Less fireflies, darker
-	Set mist to rise up through solid ground if needed

-	Create scenes
	-	Hell
		-	Far: Lava eruptions
		-	Near: Flames
		-	Near/Far: Top obsidian stallagtites
	-	Underground Crimson
		-	Near/Far: Fleshy stallagtites
	-	Underground Corruption
		-	Near/Far: Corrupt stallagtites
	-	Underground Jungle
		-	Near/Far: Vines
		-	Game: Mist near water
	-	Underground Snow
	-	Underground Rocky (excludes snow, jungle)
		-	Near/Far: Cave stallagtites
	-	Underground (excludes snow, jungle)
		-	Near/Far: Cave stallagtites
	-	Implement cave parallax (uses 2 sublayers per layer)
	-	Increase parallax differential between layers
	-	Corr trees (FG up 64, both up 64)
	-	Snow trees (down 256, FG up 64)
	-	Crim trees (FG up 64 (not BG), both down 160)
	-	Surface Crimson
		-	Near/Far: Crimson trees
	-	Surface Corruption
		-	Near/Far: Corrupt trees
	-	Surface Snow
		-	Far: Snow trees
		-	Near: Snow trees
		-	Game: Quick white mist puffs occasionally
	-	Surface Jungle
		-	Game: Light mist near water
		-	Far: Jungle trees
		-	Near: Jungle trees
	-	Surface Solar Eclipse
		-	Game: Dark mist clouds OR thin ground mist
	-	Surface Blood Moon
		-	Game: Red mist clouds near ground (Cloud_2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21)
	-	Surface Forest (night)
		-	Near: Lightning bugs
	-	Surface Forest
		-	Far: Trees
		-	Near: Trees
-	Fix direction of scroll (again)
-	Fix Y values of forest and jungle
-	Implement contrast effect in shader
-	Implement blur effect in shader
-	Implement scene fading
-	Set scene brightness to apply to render target, not draw code
-	Implement scene drawing
	-	game layer
	-	far foreground (w/ slow parallax)
	-	near foreground (w/ fast parallax)
	-	screen
-	Implement scene picker
-	Define scene logic
	-	@Plan
		-	Scene definitions supply basic rendering of a scene
		-	Scene logic picks the definitions to use
		-	Scene drawing handles parallax and stuff while drawing the chosen definitions
-	Implement foreground overlay rendering
-	Setup project
